#Arduino

This is Loren and Heming's wiki page for our Ultrasonic Robot project.
Our goal of our project is to create a trap. It will detect the object/person and turn on an LED. If the object/person countiues to come closer, it will fire an object.
A problem we may have is the ability for a servo to fire an object.
