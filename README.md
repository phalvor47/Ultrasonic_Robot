#Arduino

This is Loren and Heming's wiki page for our Ultrasonic Robot project.
Our goal of our project is to create a trap. It will detect the object/person and turn on an LED. If the object/person countiues to come closer, it will fire an object.

A problem we may have is the ability for a servo to fire an object.
The solution to this problem is having a stationary object in the front and a removable object in the back. A rubber band will then be wrapped around them. Once the servo activates, it will hit the removable object which realises the tension of the rubber band.
